We provide a toy data example, containing 3 membranes from one tomogram (https://elifesciences.org/articles/53740).

### Data preparation ###

The corresponding ground truth data positions, as well as membrane meshes are provided without requiring further processing.
For the membrane segmentations, unzip the folder "membranes.zip" in ./toy_data/tomograms/Tomo1/membranes.zip
The raw tomogram needs to be downloaded from EMDB: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-10780
It should be unzipped and placed in the folder ./toy_data/tomograms/Tomo1/tomograms


### Instructions for MemBrain ###

Step 0: Create a virtual Python environment, e.g., using miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html), 
and install packages as described in https://github.com/CellArchLab/MemBrain

Step 1: Adjust the config.py file
--> For this toy example, only few things need to be adapted:
-----> PROJECT_NAME (can also stay the same)
-----> PROJECT_DIRECTORY (this is where all outputs of MemBrain are stored; directory should exist beforehand)
-----> TOMO_DIR (where your toy_data tomograms are stored, e.g., /path/to/MemBrain/folder/MemBrain/toy_data/tomograms)
-----> USE_GPU (do you have GPU available? This will speed up training / inference)

Step 2: Run Python scripts as described in https://github.com/CellArchLab/MemBrain
